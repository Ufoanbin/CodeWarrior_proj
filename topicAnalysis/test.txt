Doesn‚Äôt it seem odd to vote against deporting illegals who commit a crime?
170 House Democrats just voted against the Laken Riley Act, refusing to require the detention and deportation of illegal immigrants who have been caught committing a crime.

Exactly
And House seats determine how many votes each state has in the electoral college.

So although illegal aliens don‚Äôt vote, they can determine the outcome of Presidential races.

Kentucky has 6 representatives, but California likely has 6 extra seats due to illegal immigration!
Most Americans are still unaware that the census counts ALL people, including illegal immigrants, for deciding how many House seats each state gets!

This results in Dem states getting roughly 20 more House seats, which is another strong incentive for them not to deport illegals.
